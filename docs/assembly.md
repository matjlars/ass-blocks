# Assembly
You can use an Assembly block to write assembly in.

Reading from a register exposes an input parameter to the block, and writing to a register exposes an output parameter to the block.

These blocks are how all other blocks eventually get translated into assembly.

The resulting assembly can then be inspected and compiled into a program!
